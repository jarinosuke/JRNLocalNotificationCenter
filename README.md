                                                         soundName:nil
                                                       launchImage:nil
                                                          userInfo:@{@"time": @"12"}
                                                        badgeCount:[[UIApplication sharedApplication] applicationIconBadgeNumber] + 1
                                                    repeatInterval:NSCalendarUnitDay];
```

- cancel scheduled local notification. 

```objectivec
[[JRNLocalNotificationCenter defaultCenter] cancelLocalNotificationForKey:@"test"];
```

- handle local notification.

```objectivec
###application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
[[JRNLocalNotificationCenter defaultCenter] setLocalNotificationHandler:^(NSString *key, NSDictionary *userInfo) {
    if ( [key isEqualToString:@"test"] ) {
        //implement handling method for "test"
    }
}];

###application:didReceiveLocalNotification:
[[JRNLocalNotificationCenter defaultCenter] didReceiveLocalNotificationUserInfo:notification.userInfo];
```

## Install
Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the best way.

```
pod 'JRNLocalNotificationCenter'
```

### I don't want to use CocoaPods.
OK, please D&D JRNLocalNotificationCenter folder into your project.
